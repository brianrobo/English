Hello Brian, 

It was a pleasure speaking with you. 

Interesting that you know about music and want to know more. I love music from that era. Some of our best. There are already links below to movies about STAX and Motown. Here's a link to the FAME studio movie: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2492916/

This message is pretty much what I give to first-time students of mine. It is more than enough to assist you in self corrective measures and hopefully will give you some new ideas in your learning. 

I advise you go through this message and work with anything that resonates with you. I feel sure there is helpful material for any ESL learner in the details below. I recommend reading the whole message and really giving it some thought and applied work. 

In language learning one must focus on the four fundamentals, reading/writing/listening/speaking, in order to reach peak proficiency. 

I see some common areas where all students can benefit from similar information. I see in all but a few students the same problems with overcoming pronunciation errors. 

It is a combination of factors that make us speak a specific way. Different languages and cultures drive us toward using our identical equipment differently. In other words, if you were born into my house when I was, you would sound like me and have my mastery of English. If I was born into your house when you were, I would have the same mastery of your language. Biologically we have the same equipment – lungs, throat, tongue, teeth, lips, nose – but we use them differently because of an accident of the location of our individual births and upbringings. 

To level the playing field and get your pronunciation of English and understanding of western culture, you need the appropriate tool box. Some items all students should have. A working knowledge of your own body will assist you greatly. I have assembled a few source documents and a link to a video that I believe will give you a more fundamental understanding of pronunciation. 

Another thing to think of is etymology – the study of the origin of words. It's good to know where our words come from to get a better feel for English. This online 'etymology dictionary' is very helpful: https://www.etymonline.com/ 

This document on 'Articulation' gives great insight into the mechanics of speaking. I believe you'll find it helpful in thinking of how to make sound. https://www.speakmethod.com/articulation.html 

Another thing to think about while on the road to better pronunciation is listening to yourself. This document will help you with a simple musician's trick to hear yourself better. You will also hear others better in this manner. Please use this information and start to really hear how you sound and then you will know what to adjust. https://www.successfulsinging.com/free-singing-guides/foldback-system/ 

One of the most useful tools for pronunciation practice is a good American English Pronunciation Dictionary. I found one early on in my teaching that I am totally satisfied with. Here is a link to the YouTube video: https://youtu.be/-SObetOJ_yY 

The way to make proper use of this tool is to mimic the teacher and do what she says. Work on a little of this at a time or perhaps use it to target trouble areas – sounds you know you reproduce unlike a native speaker that you are aware of. One good use of this tool would be to forward the video to those particular sounds and practice. Even twenty minutes a day could make a big difference. 

Be aware of minimal pairs. For instance, it's common among Asian cultures to switch the 'L' and 'R' sounds. 'R' and 'L' make up what is known as a minimal pair. Here is a link to some materials concerning minimal pairs: https://www.englishclub.com/pronunciation/minimal-pairs.htm I suggest you focus on minimal pairs that you are aware may be troublesome for you. 

Please learn to be aware of your rhythm. It will lead to better English pronunciation. Follow the 'rhythm rule'. https://pronuncian.com/rhythm-rule/ 

A bit more on the rhythm and melody of English language: http://accurateenglish.blogspot.com/2012/06/rhyhtm-and-melody-of-english.html 

An important issue that most language learners I encounter is concerning the usage of articles(a, an, the). Please read this piece from 'The Purdue Owl' concerning this topic. The Owl is also good for all academic English problems concerning the technical aspects of English writing. https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/540/01/ 

This article on word linking could be very helpful to you. https://pronuncian.com/introduction-to-linking/ 

Chunking helps one arrange sounds and thoughts for more fluid speaking. https://www.mezzoguild.com/chunking-and-language-learning/ 

It's best to be aware of the common errors that make pronunciation problematic for Japanese learners of English. This article shows these common errors and recommends changes. I found this article on common Japanese pronunciation errors. http://englishspeaklikenative.com/resources/common-pronunciation-problems/japanese-pronunciation-problems/ 

About input... All speakers need sources to learn common dialog and good pronunciation. I've put together some information that I believe can assist you in understanding American culture and English language better. Try to look at all your English movies, music, and literature as an opportunity to learn. 

Alternative News is taking off in America. The following are some of my favorite sources... 

A speaker that you may like for style is James Corbett. James is a journalist and researcher living in Japan. Anything happening in the world that you want to know about, there is a chance James has touched on the subject and will provide you with the fruits of his research. You can find him here: https://www.corbettreport.com/ Here is a link to his YouTube channel: 

Professor Wolff is an economics professor who is very good at pointing out the problems with capitalism. Here is a link to his web site: https://www.democracyatwork.info/ Here is a link to his youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK-6FjMu9OI8i0Fo6bkW0VA 

Max Keiser has an interesting financial show: https://www.maxkeiser.com/ 

You may also want to try a couple of our comedians who talk about politics. I like Jimmy Dore and Lee Camp. These are what I would call 'straight talking' Americans. You can get a lot from their speech. Here is a link to each: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3M7l8ved_rYQ45AVzS0RGA https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvaZ2RHEDrgKXz43gz7CbQ

About Movies/Series as 'INPUT'... 

I suggest you pick individual lines you like from movies or other media where you can see the faces and you have a subtitle to work with. Imitate the actor/interviewer/interviewee until you make a close enough sound for you. You can do this with any video product. News, biography, history, discussions, speeches, etc. Try to get to 70% good and continue running the video. 

Two of the movies I share with many are great movies, made separately, about the house bands at two record labels who were competing for record buyers in the 1960s - 1970s. The labels are STAX and Motown. The respective bands are 'Booker T and the MGS' and 'The Funk Brothers'. Stax was from Memphis and Motown was from Detroit. Very different approaches and stories. Both fascinating. Here's the IMDB link for 'Respect Yourself: The Stax Records Story': https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034410/. This is the IMDB link for 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown': https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314725/ 

One series I recommend is Ray Donovan. The dialogue is quite good. Good story lines and characters. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249007/ 

There are also two comedies I highly recommend – as their dialog is quite good and gives insight into our culture and 'normal' speaking habits. The movies I recommend are 'Happy Gilmore'(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116483/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and 'The Big Lebowski'(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/?ref_=nv_sr_1). Happy Gilmore is much more light-hearted and The Big Lebowski is a dark comedy. They tell a lot about American thinking, in my opinion. And they use very standard American language and themes. Very good to learn new phrases from. 

As for literature for 'INPUT'... 

The best English speakers I know have some knowledge of Mark Twain. The single best non-native English speaker I know is a Hungarian man who is a personal friend. He studied the works of Raymond Chandler in-depth. 

Twain is known as the 'Father of American Literature. His book, 'Huckleberry Finn' is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a great language learning tool. Twain writes his character's lines phonetically. It's an older form of English, but it is also the deep roots of modern English. 

Raymond Chandler is known as a master writer of Detective Novels. One of the best examples, in my opinion, would be 'Farewell My Lovely' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farewell,_My_Lovely), which was made into the movie 'Murder My Sweet' (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037101/?ref_=nv_sr_1). The dialog is quick and intelligent. The accents are great to learn from in the film version. One of those instances where the film and book are both great. You will probably notice that this dialog is a fore-runner of modern English casual speaking. 

Have you written a biography about yourself and read it out loud? I would suggest some exercises on your own time of this nature. You can do it about any topic. Ten sentences. Write them and read them back until they sound good and you can put elements of them in normal conversation with English speakers. If you want help with the style of writing English, the Purdue Owl is what many American university students us. https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/ 

For some quick thoughts and daily practice, I recommend using BrainyQuote.com. I've included links to the two authors I recommended, Mark Twain and Raymond Chandler. But you can look up any famous person you find interesting. https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/mark_twain https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/raymond_chandler

Just some suggestions, but I believe solid ones. 

I hope this is helpful. 

Thank you again. 

Kind Regards, 

Luther
