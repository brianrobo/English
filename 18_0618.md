``` diff
+ /kʊd/ strong,  /kəd/ weak :: 
+ /ˈevriˌbɑdi/ :: everybody
+ /ʃer/ :: share
```

* Sometimes they don't want to say [exactly]() how old they are, so they [might]() say something
``` diff
+ /ˈsʌmtaɪmz/ :: sometimes 
+ /maɪt/ :: might
```

* Because I don't quite wanna say exactly how old I am because I'm starting to feel older every day.
