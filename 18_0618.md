* You [could]() tell them how old you are but not everybody wants to [share]() their age
``` diff
+ /kʊd/ strong,  /kəd/ weak :: 
+ /ˈevriˌbɑdi/ :: everybody
+ /ʃer/ :: share
```

* Sometimes they don't want to say [exactly]() how old they are, so they [might]() say something
``` diff
+ /ˈsʌmtaɪmz/ :: sometimes 
+ /maɪt/ :: might
```

* Because I don't quite wanna say exactly how old I am because I'm starting to feel older every day.
``` diff
+ /kwaɪt/ :: quite
+ /ɪɡˈzæk(t)li/ :: exactly
+ /bɪˈkɔz/ ,  /bɪkəz/  :: because
```

* So that's another thing, another piece of information you could share with people.
``` diff
+ /əˈnʌðər/ :: another
+ /pis/     :: piece
+ /ˌɪnfərˈmeɪʃ(ə)n/   :: information
+ /ˈpip(ə)l/   :: people
```
